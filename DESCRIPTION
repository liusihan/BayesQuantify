Description: The ACMG/AMP guidelines have undergone continuous review and refinement 
   for different rules, genes, and diseases, driving optimization and enhancing variant 
   interpretation standards in genetic testing. In 2018, the ClinGen Sequence Variant 
   Interpretation Working Group has proposed a Bayesian Classification Framework to model
   the ACMG/AMP guidelines. This framework has successfully quantified the thresholds
   for applying PM5 and PP3/BP4. However, there are challenges for clinicians in utilising the 
   Bayesian Classification Framework, as tools and software for convincingly calculating 
   the positive likelihood ratio are lacking.
   The BayesQuantify R Package provide a comprehensive functions to define the thresholds 
   for each evidence strength level.
