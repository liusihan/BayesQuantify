Description: The guidelines proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)have undergone continuous review and refinement for different rules, genes, and diseases, driving optimization and enhancing variant interpretation standards in genetic testing. In 2018, the Clinical Genome Resource (ClinGen) Sequence Variant Interpretation (SVI) Working Group has proposed a Bayesian Classification Framework to model the ACMG/AMP guidelines. This framework has successfully quantified the thresholds for applying PM5 and PP3/BP4 criteria. However, existing software and tools designed for quantifying the evidence strength and establishing corresponding thresholds to refine the ACMG/AMP criteria are lacking.
    This package provide users with a unified resource for quantifying the strength of evidence for ACMG/AMP criteria using a naive Bayes classifier.
